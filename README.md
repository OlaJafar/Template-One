# My First HTML & CSS Project - Template One

This is my first project using **HTML** and **CSS**. I built this template to practice the basics of web development and to apply what I've learned.

### 🔗 Live Demo
You can check the live website here: [Template One](https://olajafar.github.io/Template-One/)

## What I Practiced:
* **HTML5:** Structuring the web page correctly.
* **CSS3:** Styling and layouts.
* **Flexbox:** Used for aligning items and creating flexible layouts.
* **CSS Grid:** Used for building complex and organized grid systems.
* **Responsive Design:** The template is fully responsive and works well on all screen sizes (Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop).

## Why I Built This:
The main goal was to practice:
1. How to use Flexbox and Grid together.
2. How to make a website look good on different devices.
3. Improving my skills in CSS positioning and layout design.
